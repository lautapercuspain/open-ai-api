## The idea

It all started when Lautaro, my partner, created a simple website where developers could ask for code ideas 
and the AI would generate code. After some conversations between us, we realized that this could be the 
basis for a more comprehensive product.

<br />

## The process

<br />

The process of developing our product began with benchmarking the competition to get a sense of what was already available in the market. 
We then decided to focus on the features that would be most valuable to developers. We narrowed down our ideas to our first MVP iteration, 
which included our winning features: test functions, documentation mode, AI chat assistant, code improvements, and code suggestions.
<br />
During the ideation process, we came up with many ideas that we wanted to try. So we put aside many ideas 
and left them in our backlog for future iterations after the first release.
This approach has allowed us to develop a product that is both valuable to 
developers and meets their needs. We are confident that our product will continue to improve 
over time as we learn from our users and add new features.

## Our MVP launch 

<br />

We launched Code Genius in record time (2 months) on Product Hunt and in other developer communities. 
We received feedback from our early adopter users, which was crucial to us since it allowed us to validate our
first hypothesis and identify areas of opportunity. Based on the feedback,
we began creating a backlog of priorities to start the iteration process. We started with quick wins 
and then moved on to high-impact priorities.

## Conclusion

<br />

Creating a product from scratch is difficult, but creating a product that people love is even more difficult, but not impossible. 
It takes time and effort to discover what is valuable to your customers, but it is also a very rewarding experience. 
Every mistake and piece of feedback has been another stepping stone towards our goal of creating a better product. 
So yes, the journey is long, but it is worth taking because this experience has taught us a lot about product development.
