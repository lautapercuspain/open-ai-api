Today, we're excited to launch [Code Genius](/) – a tool designed to help developers be more productive.

<br />

Since the launch of [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/), on December 2022, we noticed an interesting pattern – _more and more developers were relying on AI to help themself with daily tasks_.

So we decided to build a tool that can act as your main pair programming to help our users find answers to their questions – without needing to browse the entire Internet.

## How a tool like Code Genius can help in daily tasks?

Code Genius was created by developers to developers. This tool uses AI (Open AI API) to give support to the following common tasks:

<br />

- **Start creating an app from scratch**: <p>You describe in simple words what you would like to create and Code Genius will help you organize the project.</p>
- **Creating unit test code**: <p>Testing code is important but sometimes we don't have the time to do it.</p>
  Code Genius can generate unit tests from existing code in seconds. Additionally, you have the ability to choose your preferred testing libraries and frameworks.
- **Creating documentation**: <p>You just need to copy/paste your existing code, and Code Genius will analyze and generate detailed docs for you.</p>
- **Improving Code Performance**: <p>In a similar fashion, to improve the performance of your code, you only need to paste it and Code Genius will give you clear steps with code examples for you to apply and get better performance.</p>
- **Chat with an expert dev assistant**:<p>Last but not least, we enable a Code Chat GTP-like agent that will help you with any request you may have. Whenevt is a bug in your code or a question about something in particular the Code Genius agent can help you find the answer to your need. </p>
