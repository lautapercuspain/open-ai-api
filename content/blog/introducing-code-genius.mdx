Today, we're excited to launch the [Code Genius](/) – a tool designed for developers. A tool to help developers achieve their tasks faster than ever.

Since the launch of [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/), on December 2022, we noticed an interesting pattern – _more and more developers were relaying on AI to help with daily tasks_.

So we decided to build a Developer tool that can act as Chat GPT but with focus on engineering, to help our users find answers to their questions – without needing to browse the entire Internet.

## How a tool like Code Genius can help in daily tasks?

Code Genius was created from developers to developers. This tool uses AI (Open AI API) to give support to the following common tasks:

- Creating an App from scrach - _from idea to implementation_
- Creating unit test code to help testing excisting functionallity
- Creating documentation for existing code
- Improving Code Performance for existing code
- Chat with an expert dev assistant

We've also created categories to help you find the articles you're looking for:

## Intuitive Search Experience – at your fingertips

The Help Center features a beautiful search experience that lets you find answers to your questions in a snap.

Our new search feature is typo-tolerant and lets you search for articles based on their title and anchor headings.

The best part: **It can be accessed anywhere on Dub – even inside the [Dub dashboard](https://app.dub.sh) itself**! All you need to do is enter the magic command: `CMD+K` (or `CTRL+K` on Windows). Go ahead and give it a try!

We're also planning to add an AI assistant to help you find answers to your questions in the future:
