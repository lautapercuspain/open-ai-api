If you are reading this, you probably know the impact AI is doing in our society.
It's bringing a positive changes in our world, including enhanced productivity, improved healthcare, and increased access to education.
Personally I'm passionate about education, because I think it can change lives and make a positive impact.
I come from a family of teachers, my mather is an economy teacher in UBA (University of Buenos Aires),
and my father was a professor of literature and journalism in TEA, UP and Eter.

<br />

But let's talk about AI in education and see how can evolve traditional learning.

## How can be the E-learning proccess improved with AI?

Artificial Inteligence and machine learning uses data collected from previous interactions, to build a model that can be used
to improve the learning experience by providing better feedback, a more tailored material for each
student and making sure that their progress is tracked accurately.

<br />

Aside from that, this _model_ can adapt the content on demand based on the studentâ€™s
individual needs and provide personalised support and feedback based on their response
and performance level.

<br />

AI also allows for a system of intelligent grading and assessment that can provide
educators with real-time information on their students' strengths and weaknesses.

<br />

## These are the specif areas where AI is transforming education and making great improvements in the e-learning industry:

<br />

- Personalised learning paths
- Adaptive learning
- Intelligent tutoring systems
- Natural language processing
- Predictive analytics
- Content creation
- Gamification in e-learning

<br />

Let's take a look to the above picture and think in the term: _Gamification in e-learning_.
It literally means, "to have fun while learning at the same time". If you think a moment in tradictional learning,
you will probably picture a class of students hearing what a profesor is repeating over and over, making the learning process, bored.

<br />
The process of having fun while learning at the same time, is a powerfull combination,
that can create interest and motivation.

## Intelligent tutoring systems

<br />

An intelligent tutoring system can help automate the e-learning proccess and
offer specific content to the student, leting them find relevant content fast
and accurately.

## What Does the Future Look Like with AI?

The role of AI in e-learning will continue to evolve in the future. As it is changing the way we learn,
future trends of AI are constantly developing and creating interactive simulations for students to understand difficult concepts better.

<br />

AI is playing a significant role in the present of e-learning by providing educators with powerful tools that they can use to
create engaging content quickly, easily and efficiently.

<br />
It is revolutionising the e-learning industry and the potential for AI-driven e-learning
is immense. It is set to continue transforming the e-learning industry and provide
a wealth of opportunities for students and instructors alike. With the right strategies
and resources in place, AI can change and is changing the way we learn and teach,
ushering in a new era of e-learning.
