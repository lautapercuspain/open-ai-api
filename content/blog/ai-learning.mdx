## How can Artificial Intelligence improve the E-learning proccess?

AI uses data collected from previous interactions with students, to build a model that can be used
to improve the learning experience by providing better feedback, more tailored material for each
student and making sure that their progress is tracked accurately.

This smart system can adapt the content on demand based on the student’s
individual needs and provide personalised support and feedback based on their
response and performance level.

AI also allows for a system of intelligent grading and assessment that can provide educators
with real-time information on their students' strengths and weaknesses.

## These are the specif areas where AI is transforming education and making great improvements in the e-learning industry:

<br />

- Personalised learning paths
- Adaptive learning
- Intelligent tutoring systems
- Natural language processing
- Predictive analytics
- Content creation
- Gamification in e-learning

Our new search feature is typo-tolerant and lets you search for articles based on their title and anchor headings.

The best part: **It can be accessed anywhere on Dub – even inside the [Dub dashboard](https://app.dub.sh) itself**! All you need to do is enter the magic command: `CMD+K` (or `CTRL+K` on Windows). Go ahead and give it a try!

We're also planning to add an AI assistant to help you find answers to your questions in the future:
