Evrything starts from an idea. The human mind remains a mistery.
But we know something that is true: Curiosity is the true engine of the mind, it's the fuel that makes the wheel run.

To make great things we need to start from an idea, and then bisect that into smaller pieces to create the perfect puzzle.

<h2 className="my-4 text-2xl font-semibold">What is pair programming?</h2>

Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at a single computer on the same task.
In this collaborative approach, one programmer is the "driver" who actively writes the code, while the other programmer is the "observer" or "navigator" who reviews each line of code being written.

<br />
The main features of pair programming are:
<br />

- Collaboration
- Real-time code review
- Continuous feedback
- Knowledge transfer
- Increased productivity

Many teams and big companies, including Google and Facebook, use pair programming in order to be more productive and get all the benefits listed above.

Code Genius, in this context, is the Observer and your pair programming buddy.
