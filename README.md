## Status

- Codegenius is open source: anyone can contribute in order to help the project grow!
- The project is built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [RSC](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components).
- We are up and running on our [official website](https://www.code-genius.dev/), but still there's a lot of work to do in order to make Codegenius the best.
- Our community keeps expanding, with new devs contributing to the project everyday.
- If you are interested in partnerships and sponsors, please contact [@lautapercuspain](https://www.github.com/lautapercuspain).

## Folder structure

- We are using the [Next.js App directory](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) to provide a solid skeleton for our project.
- The aforementioned [RSC](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) is a key part of our website.
- [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) is a must, being the base of Codegenius since day one!
- Every one of our routes includes a page.tsx and client.tsx file. Page.tsx is a RSC by default, usually Client.tsx is a client component and it should use the use client directive at the top of the file.

```Example of our repo's internal structure
